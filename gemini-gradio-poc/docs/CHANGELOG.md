## [2025-06-04] - Fixed ChatInterface Parameter Mismatch

### Fixed
- **TypeError in chat_and_update Function**: Fixed the `TypeError: create_gradio_interface.<locals>.chat_and_update() takes 3 positional arguments but 5 were given` error that was occurring when using the chat interface.
- **Root Cause**: The `chat_and_update` function was defined with only 3 parameters, but the Gradio ChatInterface was configured to pass 5 parameters when it was called.
- **Technical Solution**:
  - Updated `chat_and_update` function to accept all required parameters: `user_input`, `history`, `rag_state_df`, `mode`, and `industry`
  - Made `mode` and `industry` parameters optional with default values of `None`
  - Ensured consistent `additional_inputs` configuration when reassigning the function to the ChatInterface

### Impact
- The Gradio UI now works correctly without the TypeError
- Chat functionality is fully operational
- Parameter consistency maintained throughout the interface

### Files Modified
- `interface/chat_app.py`: Updated `chat_and_update` function definition and maintained configuration consistency

## [2025-01-10] - Debug Enhancements for RAG History Processing

### Added
- Comprehensive debug logging in `rag_generate` function to track history processing
- Detailed history analysis at function entry point showing:
  - History type and length
  - Structure of first few history items
  - Content preview of history items
- Step-by-step processing logs for each history item showing:
  - Item type and format detection
  - Extracted user and model messages
  - Validation results
- Final contents structure debug output before API call showing:
  - Total number of content items
  - Role and text preview for each content item
  - Text length for each content part

### Purpose
These debug enhancements help diagnose issues with:
- Different history formats (list/tuple vs dict)
- Empty or malformed history items
- Content validation failures
- API input structure problems

### Usage
The debug output is automatically printed to console when `rag_generate` is called. Look for sections marked with:
- `=== DEBUG: History Analysis ===` - Shows incoming history structure
- `--- Processing history item X ---` - Shows individual item processing
- `=== DEBUG: Final Contents Structure ===` - Shows final API input

### Dependencies
No new dependencies required. Uses existing:
- `google.genai` for API interactions
- Standard Python types for content structure

### Example Output
```
=== DEBUG: History Analysis ===
History type: <class 'list'>
History length: 2
First history item type: <class 'tuple'>
First history item content: ('What is ML?', 'Machine learning is...')

History item 0:
  Type: <class 'tuple'>
  Length: 2
  Item[0] type: <class 'str'>, preview: What is ML?...
  Item[1] type: <class 'str'>, preview: Machine learning is...
=== END DEBUG: History Analysis ===
```

## [2025-05-24] - Function Refactoring and Optimization

### Optimized
- **chat_with_rag Function**: Refactored the main chat function to remove unused variables and improve code clarity
  - **Removed unused `client` variable**: The `initialize_gemini_client()` call now only validates the API key without storing the unused client object
  - **Eliminated redundant variable assignments**: Removed duplicate `chatbot_response_string` and `summary_val` variables that held the same value
  - **Simplified return structure**: Using `response_summary` variable directly for both chat response and summary display
  - **Improved variable naming**: Renamed `chatbot_response_string` to `response_summary` for better clarity
  - **Cleaned up comments**: Removed redundant inline comments and improved code documentation

### Technical Benefits
- Reduced memory usage by eliminating unused variables
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Simplified variable flow and reduced redundancy
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving performance

### Files Modified
- `interface/chat_app.py` - `chat_with_rag()` function refactored

## [2025-05-24] - Warning Behavior Documentation

### Clarified
- **Warning Messages in RAG Processing**: Documented that warning messages like "Warning: Empty user message in history item X, skipping" and "Warning: Empty model response in history item X, skipping" are **expected behavior** and indicate the robust error handling system is working correctly
- **Normal Operation**: These warnings appear when the system encounters empty or malformed chat history items and gracefully filters them out instead of crashing
- **Benefits**: The warning system provides transparency, prevents crashes, and aids in debugging while maintaining full application functionality

### Technical Details
- Warnings originate from enhanced error handling in `utils/rag_utils.py` (lines 307-315)
- System continues normal operation after displaying warnings
- No action required unless the application actually crashes or fails

### Usage
Users can safely ignore these warning messages as they indicate the system is working properly to handle edge cases in chat history data.

  - Moved all component creation inside proper column contexts
  - Removed duplicate component creation and redundant `.render()` calls
  - Updated ChatInterface configuration to properly reference output components
  - Added specific CSS classes for better column control

### Technical Details
- Components are now properly nested within their intended layout hierarchy
- Left column (60% width) contains the chat interface
- Right column (40% width) contains knowledge base setup and rule summary
- Fixed component references in ChatInterface additional_outputs

### Dependencies
- Gradio interface components
- No additional dependencies required

### Usage
The interface now properly displays two distinct columns from initial load, improving user experience and interface organization.

## 2025-05-19

### Changed
- Removed the JSON display block from the UI for a cleaner interface (see [UI Updates Documentation](./ui_updates.md) for details)

### Added
- Agent 2: Converts JSON rule output to Drools DRL and GDST files using Google Gen AI (`google.genai`).
- Verification step for Drools execution (currently a placeholder).
- Gradio UI: 'Preview & Apply' button triggers Agent 2, generates files, verifies, and provides download links.
- File download and status components in the interface.
- Unit tests for Agent 2 logic.

### How to Use
1. Interact with the chatbot to generate a rule (Agent 1).
2. Click the 'Preview & Apply' button in the UI to generate and verify DRL/GDST files from the latest rule.
3. Download the generated files if verification is successful.

### Dependencies
- `google-genai` (https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/index.html)
- `gradio`

### Example Usage
- Enter a business rule in the chat (e.g., "If a customer orders more than $100, apply a 10% discount.").
- Click 'Preview & Apply'.
- Download the generated `.drl` and `.gdst` files from the right panel.

## [2025-05-23] - Three-Column Layout and UI Cleanup

## [2025-05-23] - Bugfix: Knowledge Base Build Exception Handling

### Fixed
- Corrected a bug in `build_knowledge_base_process` where an undefined variable `s` was used in the exception handler. Now returns the correct status message on error.

## 2025-05-23

### Fixed Gradio ChatInterface Output Bug
- **Issue:** The `chat_with_rag` function returned too many output values, causing a Gradio error: "A function (_submit_fn) returned too many output values (needed: 2, returned: 5). Ignoring extra values."
- **Fix:** Updated `chat_with_rag` to return outputs in the order and number expected by Gradio's `ChatInterface` with `additional_outputs`:
  - (chatbot response string, updated chat history, name, summary, logic)
- **Impact:** The chat interface now works as intended, with all side panel outputs updating correctly and no Gradio warnings.

### How to Use
- Use the Gradio UI as before. The chat, name, summary, and logic fields will update as expected after each chat turn.

- **Enhancements:**
  - Added type hints and improved docstrings for maintainability.
  - The generator function now only handles Gradio status updates and delegates all logic to the core function.
  - The core function can be directly tested with file paths, chunk size, and overlap, and returns a status message and DataFrame.
- **How to Test:**
  - You can now write unit tests for `_core_build_knowledge_base` by mocking file reading and embedding dependencies.

## 2025-05-23

### Modularized chat_app.py and Extracted Utility Logic
- **Refactor:** Extracted the core knowledge base building logic to a new file `kb_utils.py` as `core_build_knowledge_base`.
- **chat_app.py:** Now only contains Gradio interface, event wiring, and high-level event handler functions. All core logic is delegated to `kb_utils.py`.
- **Benefits:**
  - Easier to debug and maintain the Gradio interface.
  - Utility logic is now easily unit-testable and reusable.
  - Clearer separation of concerns between UI and backend logic.

## 2025-05-23

### Modularized Rule Summary/Generation Logic

## [2025-05-23] - Bugfix: Gradio ChatInterface State KeyError

### Fixed
- **KeyError: 0 in Gradio ChatInterface**: Fixed a bug where the Gradio UI would crash with a KeyError due to improper state registration in the ChatInterface.
- **Technical Details**: The `state` parameter is now passed directly to the `gr.ChatInterface` constructor instead of being set after creation. This ensures Gradio correctly registers the state block and prevents KeyError on UI interaction.

### How to Use
- Launch the UI as before. The chat, knowledge base, and rule summary panels will work without backend KeyErrors.

### Dependencies
- `gradio` (see [Gradio documentation](https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio/interface))
- `google-genai` (see [Google GenAI SDK](https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/index.html))

### Example
No change to usage. Launch the UI and interact with the chatbot as before.

## [2025-05-23] - Bugfix: Gradio ChatInterface State Argument Error

### Fixed
- **TypeError: ChatInterface.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'state'**: Updated the code to remove the unsupported `state` argument from the `gr.ChatInterface` constructor. State is now set after creation using `chat_interface.state = state_rag_df`, as per Gradio 5.29.0 documentation.

### How to Use
- Launch the UI as before. The chat, knowledge base, and rule summary panels will work without backend errors.

### Dependencies
- `gradio` (see [Gradio documentation](https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio/interface))
- `google-genai` (see [Google GenAI SDK](https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/index.html))

### Example
No change to usage. Launch the UI and interact with the chatbot as before.

## [2025-05-23] - Gradio State Management Bugfix

### Fixed
- **KeyError in ChatInterface with State**: Updated the Gradio ChatInterface to use the correct state management pattern. State is now passed as an `additional_input` and `additional_output` to the ChatInterface, and not set via `.state` after creation. This prevents the KeyError and ensures state is properly registered and updated.

### How to Use
- Launch the UI as before. The chat, knowledge base, and rule summary panels will work without backend KeyErrors.

### Dependencies
- `gradio` (see [Gradio documentation](https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio/interface))
- `google-genai` (see [Google GenAI SDK](https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/index.html))

### Example
No change to usage. Launch the UI and interact with the chatbot as before.

- Uses Google Gen AI SDK (`google.genai`).

### Example
- Launch the app and verify that the layout is three columns wide from the beginning.

## 2025-05-27

### Added
- Added a new column in the 'Configuration' tab for editing agent configuration variables (AGENT1_PROMPT, AGENT2_PROMPT, DEFAULT_MODEL, GENERATION_CONFIG) directly from the UI. These fields are initialized with the default values from `agent_config.py`.

### How to Use (Updated)
- In the 'Configuration' tab, use the right column to view or edit the agent prompts, model, and generation config. Changes here can be used to update the runtime configuration (future: add Save/Apply functionality).
