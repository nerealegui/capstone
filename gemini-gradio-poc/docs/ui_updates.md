# UI Updates Documentation

## JSON Display Block Removal

### Description
The JSON display block has been removed from the UI to provide a cleaner interface. This change simplifies the user experience by focusing only on the essential information that users need to see.

### Changes Made
1. Removed the `logic_display` component definition in the `create_gradio_interface` function
2. Removed the reference to `logic` in the return statement of the `chat_and_update` function
3. Removed `logic_display` from the `additional_outputs` parameter in the ChatInterface
4. Removed the `logic_display.render()` line in the right panel

### Files Modified
- `/Users/nerealegui/Documents/GitHub/Repos/capstone/gemini-gradio-poc/chat_app.py`
- `/Users/nerealegui/Documents/GitHub/Repos/capstone/gemini-gradio-poc/docs/CHANGELOG.md` (moved from root directory)

### Impact
The UI now displays only the rule name and summary, making it more focused and less cluttered. The underlying functionality remains intact - the backend still processes the full rule logic, but only the essential information is displayed to the user.

### Related Components
The application still maintains:
- Rule name display
- Rule summary display
- Preview & Apply functionality
- File download capabilities

### Future Considerations
If detailed logic displays are needed in the future, consider adding a toggle or expandable section to display the JSON only when requested by the user.
