# UI Updates Documentation

## JSON Display Block Removal

### Description
The JSON display block has been removed from the UI to provide a cleaner interface. This change simplifies the user experience by focusing only on the essential information that users need to see.

### Changes Made
1. Removed the `logic_display` component definition in the `create_gradio_interface` function
2. Removed the reference to `logic` in the return statement of the `chat_and_update` function
3. Removed `logic_display` from the `additional_outputs` parameter in the ChatInterface
4. Removed the `logic_display.render()` line in the right panel

### Files Modified
- `gemini-gradio-poc/chat_app.py`
- `gemini-gradio-poc/docs/CHANGELOG.md` (moved from root directory)

### Impact
The UI now displays only the rule name and summary, making it more focused and less cluttered. The underlying functionality remains intact - the backend still processes the full rule logic, but only the essential information is displayed to the user.

### Related Components
The application still maintains:
- Rule name display
- Rule summary display
- Preview & Apply functionality
- File download capabilities

### Future Considerations
If detailed logic displays are needed in the future, consider adding a toggle or expandable section to display the JSON only when requested by the user.

## 2025-05-23 - Three-Column Layout and UI Cleanup

### Description
- The "Additional Inputs" dropdown has been removed from the UI for a cleaner user experience.
- The Gradio interface now uses a three-column layout:
  1. **Chat Interface**: For interacting with the chatbot and entering rule descriptions or questions.
  2. **Knowledge Base Setup**: For uploading documents and configuring the RAG knowledge base.
  3. **Rule Summary**: For displaying the rule name, summary, logic, and providing file download/status options.

### How to Use
- Use the left column to chat with the bot and generate rules.
- Use the middle column to upload documents and build the knowledge base.
- Use the right column to view rule details, preview/apply rules, and download generated files.

### Dependencies
- `gradio`
- `google-genai`

### Example Usage
1. Enter a rule description in the Chat Interface and submit.
2. Upload relevant documents in the Knowledge Base Setup and build the knowledge base.
3. View the generated rule summary and download files from the Rule Summary column.

### Impact
- The UI is now more organized and user-friendly, with clear separation of chat, knowledge base, and rule summary functionalities.
