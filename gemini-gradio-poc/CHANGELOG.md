- Knowledge base (KB) update logic now merges new rules/documents with the existing KB DataFrame instead of replacing it.
- Deduplication is performed on the merged KB based on both `filename` and `chunk` content.

### Changed
- `core_build_knowledge_base` in `utils/kb_utils.py` now accepts an optional `existing_kb_df` parameter and merges new chunks/rules with the existing KB.
- `build_knowledge_base_process` in `interface/chat_app.py` always passes the current KB DataFrame to `core_build_knowledge_base` for merging.
