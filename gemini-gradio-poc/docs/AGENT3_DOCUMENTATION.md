## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

1. **Start a Conversation**
   ```
   User: "Create a rule for 10% discount on orders over $100"
   Agent 3: I've analyzed your request and created a discount rule. Let me check for conflicts...
   ```

2. **Check for Conflicts**
   ```
   User: "Are there any conflicts with my new pricing rule?"
   Agent 3: I've found no conflicts with existing rules. Here's the impact analysis...
   ```

3. **Analyze Impact**
   ```
   User: "What's the impact of changing our employee scheduling rule?"
   Agent 3: Based on your restaurant context, here are the potential impacts...
   ```

### With Existing Agents

```python
# Complete workflow example
def complete_rule_workflow(user_input, knowledge_base, industry="restaurant"):
    # Step 1: Agent 3 processes user input
    response = chat_with_agent3(user_input, [], knowledge_base, industry)
    
    # Step 2: If rule creation detected, analyze conflicts
    if rule_response:
        conflicts, analysis = analyze_rule_conflicts(
            rule_response, existing_rules, industry
        )
        
        # Step 3: Assess impact
        impact = assess_rule_impact(rule_response, existing_rules, industry)
        
        # Step 4: User decision and orchestration
        decision = get_user_decision()
        should_proceed, status, result = orchestrate_rule_generation(
            decision, rule_response, conflicts
        )
        
        # Step 5: Generate files if approved
        if should_proceed:
            # Trigger Agent 2 for DRL/GDST generation
            pass
    
    return response
```

### With Gradio UI

```python
# Enhanced chat interface
def chat_and_update_agent3(user_input, history, rag_state_df, mode, industry):
    if mode == "Enhanced Agent 3":
        response = chat_with_agent3(user_input, history, rag_state_df, industry)
    else:
        response = chat_with_rag(user_input, history, rag_state_df)
    
    return response, name, summary, rag_state_df
