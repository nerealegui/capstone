# Business Documentation

## Project Overview

This capstone project aims to create a **business tool** that introduces a **layer of abstraction** for rule management through an **agent-based recommendation system**, empowering non-technical users to manage complex business logic without needing direct technical intervention.

## Main Business Goal
Enable a new generation of intelligent, user-friendly decision systems that allow non-technical business users to design, execute, and adapt complex decision rules autonomously, increasing operational agility and reducing technical dependency.

*Empower business users to create, manage, and evolve decision-making rules independently through an intelligent, agent-driven system â€” blending traditional rule management with the adaptability and power of modern AI.*

## Use Case: Fast Food Restaurant - Employee Scheduling

|  | Before (Drools) | After (our solution) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| How to change a rule | Email IT + wait days | Chat with AI and done in minutes |
| Who is needed | Manager + IT Developer | Just Manager |
| Speed | Slow | Fast |
| Risk of mistakes | High | Low |

| Problem Solved | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Making rule changes **easy** for non-tech people | An **AI/Agent helper** that talks to users and updates the business logic automatically |

## Features

- **Core Functionality**: Implements key features to address the project's primary objectives.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind to accommodate future growth.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensures an intuitive and seamless user experience.
- **Robust Architecture**: Built using modern development practices for maintainability and performance.
- **Rule Management**: Enables non-technical users to create and modify business rules through natural language
- **Agent-Based Architecture**: Uses AI agents to interpret user requests and translate them into rule changes
- **Validation System**: Detects conflicts between rules and validates changes before implementation
- **Business Logic Abstraction**: Provides an abstraction layer over complex rule systems
- **Future Capabilities**:
  - Recommend new rules based on business patterns
  - Detect rule conflicts automatically
  - Suggest optimizations based on business results

## Example Workflow

1. **Upload Documents**: Add your business policy documents, procedures, or rule specifications
2. **Build Knowledge Base**: Click "Build Knowledge Base" to process and index your documents
3. **Ask Questions**: Use natural language to query your business rules:
   - *"What is the discount policy for customers over $100?"*
   - *"How should we handle employee scheduling conflicts?"*
   - *"What are the approval requirements for large orders?"*
4. **Generate Rules**: Request rule generation:
   - *"Create a rule for 10% discount on orders over $100"*
   - *"Generate a scheduling rule for weekend shifts"*
5. **Download Files**: Get the generated DRL and GDST files for implementation
