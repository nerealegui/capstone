- Always use the Google Gen AI SDK as a reference. This is the URL https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/index.html
- Use google.genai whenever possible over google.generativeai and verify the proposed method exists in the API before proposing a new solution
- The interface is built with Gradio and this documentation should be taken as reference for any new iteration https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio/interface
- The repository I'm working on is https://github.com/nerealegui/capstone 
- Always propose a plan before writing the code
- Use the following format for the plan:
  - **Plan**: 
    - Step 1: [Description of step 1]
    - Step 2: [Description of step 2]
    - ...
- Always document the code that you write in an additional document file, if it doesn't already exist create a changelog. The documentation should be in markdown format and should include:
  - A brief description of the code
  - How to use the code
  - Any dependencies or requirements
  - Examples of usage
