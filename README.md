# Capstone Project: Intelligent Business Rule Management

## Project Overview

This capstone project aims to create a **business tool** that introduces a **layer of abstraction** for rule management through an **agent-based recommendation system**, empowering non-technical users to manage complex business logic without needing direct technical intervention.

We are exploring two potential technical architectures:

1. **Traditional BRMS** using **Drools** for rule management.
2. **Modern Agent/LLM-based system** where:
    - **An orchestrator/agent layer** filters inputs.
    - **An LLM wrapper** (such as Gemini or GPT) processes context and intent.
    - **Agent-to-agent communication** allows advanced rule recommendation and execution.
    - **Extensions** can enhance capabilities dynamically (e.g., plugins for different industries).

### Main Business Goal

Enable a new generation of intelligent, user-friendly decision systems that allow non-technical business users to design, execute, and adapt complex decision rules autonomously, increasing operational agility and reducing technical dependency.

*Empower business users to create, manage, and evolve decision-making rules independently through an intelligent, agent-driven system â€” blending traditional rule management with the adaptability and power of modern AI.*

### Use Case: Fast Food Restaurant - Employee Scheduling

|  | Before (Drools) | After (our solution) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| How to change a rule | Email IT + wait days | Chat with AI and done in minutes |
| Who is needed | Manager + IT Developer | Just Manager |
| Speed | Slow | Fast |
| Risk of mistakes | High | Low |

| Problem Solved | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Making rule changes **easy** for non-tech people | An **AI/Agent helper** that talks to users and updates the business logic automatically |

## Features

- **Core Functionality**: Implements key features to address the project's primary objectives.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind to accommodate future growth.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensures an intuitive and seamless user experience.
- **Robust Architecture**: Built using modern development practices for maintainability and performance.
- **Rule Management**: Enables non-technical users to create and modify business rules through natural language

## Project Components

| Component | Suggested Tool | Description | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **LLM (Large Language Model)** | Google Gemini API | The brain that understands what the user requests and translates it into actions | Interprets human language and translates it into structured rule modifications |
| **Agent Framework** | LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen | The orchestrator that controls how different tasks are executed | Enables the system to behave like a smart assistant, following multiple steps |
| **Rule Storage** | JSON files | Where the business rules are stored and managed | Provides a simple way to store and update rules without complex database architecture |
| **Backend Server** | Python (FastAPI) | The engine that receives user requests, communicates with AI, and updates rules | Creates a safe middleware between users and the AI system |
| **Frontend** | Chat UI or simple form | The user interface for business users | Provides an easy and friendly way for non-technical users to interact with the system |
